### I'm new to GitHub and want to start working on Kaggle projects for Data Science. I've been working with Python and JupterNotebooks for the last 6 years in undergrad and grad school. I have been exposed to some C and C++, but prefer Mathematica when it comes to running calculations. Whenever a physics or math question comes to my mind, I code it up and make some plots. I co-wrote some ImageJ macros in Java to aid me in microscope image analysis in the lab. I have shared my homeworks and solutions for my ML/Stats/Astronomy class.
