### I'm new to GitHub and want to start working on Kaggle projects. I've been working with Python and JupterNotebooks for the last 8 years in undergrad and grad school. I have been exposed to some C and C++, but prefer Mathematica when it comes to running calculations. I wrote some visualization files for PCA for fun. I co-wrote some Java code for ImageJ macros to aid me in image analysis in the lab.
