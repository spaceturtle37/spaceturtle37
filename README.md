### I'm new to GitHub and want to start working on Kaggle projects. I've been working with Python and JupterNotebooks for the last 8 years in undergrad and grad school. I have been exposed to some C and C++, but prefer Mathematica when it comes to running calculations. I wrote a visualization for PCA, illustrating the effect of variance and covariance. I worte other code in Mathematica for fun, related to physics or math questions that come to my mind. I co-wrote some Java code for ImageJ macros to aid me in image analysis in the lab. I have shared my homeworks and solutions for my ML/Astronomy class.
